# ABOUTME: Test plan for analyzing coloring page competitor sites to identify topic sources
# ABOUTME: Part of coloring-prepub project discovery phase

feature:
  name: topic_source_analysis
  description: Analyze competitor coloring page sites to identify topic categorization patterns
  category: coloring-prepub
  project: projects/coloring-prepub

context: |
  Before building topic discovery automation, we need to understand:
  1. What categories/sources exist beyond our initial guess (seasonal, trending, evergreen)
  2. How competitors organize their content
  3. What patterns emerge across sites

  This informs both the topic database schema and the discovery approaches.

competitors:
  - url: https://coloringbunny.com/
    name: Coloring Bunny
  - url: https://mondaymandala.com/
    name: Monday Mandala
  - url: https://www.creativekidscolor.com/
    name: Creative Kids Color

learning_goals:
  - Identify all top-level category types used by competitors
  - Discover category patterns we hadn't considered
  - Understand how sites balance seasonal vs evergreen content
  - Note any unique categorization approaches worth adopting

hypotheses:
  - id: h1
    statement: "Competitors use more than 3 top-level source types"
    rationale: Our initial guess was seasonal/trending/evergreen - likely too simplistic
    evidence_needed:
      - List of all category types from each site
      - Categories that don't fit our 3 buckets
      - Common patterns across sites

  - id: h2
    statement: "Age/difficulty segmentation is a major organizing principle"
    rationale: Coloring pages serve different skill levels
    evidence_needed:
      - How sites segment by age or difficulty
      - Whether this is top-level or secondary organization

  - id: h3
    statement: "Licensed vs original content is handled differently"
    rationale: Disney/Marvel etc have different constraints than original art
    evidence_needed:
      - How sites categorize licensed content
      - Whether they separate or mix with original

experiments:
  - id: site_structure_analysis
    hypothesis_id: h1
    description: Analyze navigation and category structure of each competitor
    test_steps:
      - Fetch homepage of each site
      - Extract main navigation categories
      - Map subcategory structure (1-2 levels deep)
      - Identify any "browse by" or filter options
    expected:
      - Clear list of top-level categories per site
      - Understanding of hierarchy depth
      - Notes on unique approaches

  - id: category_comparison
    hypothesis_id: h1
    description: Compare categories across all three sites
    depends_on: site_structure_analysis
    test_steps:
      - Create unified list of all categories found
      - Group similar categories (e.g., "Animals" vs "Animal Coloring Pages")
      - Identify categories unique to one site
      - Identify categories present on all sites
    expected:
      - Master category taxonomy
      - Gaps in our initial model
      - Recommended categories for our schema

  - id: content_mix_analysis
    hypothesis_id: h2
    description: Analyze how sites balance different content types
    test_steps:
      - Sample 20-30 pages from each site
      - Categorize by our taxonomy
      - Note seasonal vs evergreen ratio
      - Note original vs licensed ratio
    expected:
      - Content mix percentages
      - Insights on what's working (if traffic data visible)

outputs:
  location: projects/coloring-prepub/validation/topic_sources/
  files:
    - site_analysis_{site_name}.md: Per-site category breakdown
    - category_taxonomy.md: Unified taxonomy with recommendations
    - schema_recommendations.md: Suggested fields for topic database

success_metrics:
  - "Identified all major category types across competitors"
  - "Have clear taxonomy for our topic database"
  - "Understand any categories we should avoid (licensing issues)"
  - "Know what differentiates successful organization"
