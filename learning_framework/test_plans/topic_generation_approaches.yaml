# ABOUTME: Test plan for experimenting with different topic generation approaches
# ABOUTME: Part of coloring-prepub project discovery phase

feature:
  name: topic_generation_approaches
  description: Test different methods for discovering and generating coloring page topics
  category: coloring-prepub
  project: projects/coloring-prepub

context: |
  We identified 3 main topic sources from competitor analysis:
  - Seasonal/calendar (holidays, months, seasons)
  - Evergreen (animals, nature, fantasy, etc.)
  - Trending/pop culture (movies, games, anime)

  Now we need to test different approaches for generating topics in each category
  to understand what data we get and what's worth capturing in the schema.

learning_goals:
  - Understand what data each generation approach produces
  - Compare quality and actionability of different approaches
  - Identify which approaches are worth automating
  - Inform final database schema design

hypotheses:
  - id: h1
    statement: "Calendar-based discovery produces actionable seasonal topics"
    rationale: Seasonal content has clear timing windows - should be most structured
    evidence_needed:
      - List of upcoming events/holidays with dates
      - Topic ideas per event
      - Useful metadata (timing, audience, etc.)

  - id: h2
    statement: "LLM brainstorming produces quality evergreen topic ideas"
    rationale: Evergreen topics don't need external data - pure generation task
    evidence_needed:
      - Topic lists by subcategory
      - Novelty/uniqueness of ideas
      - Whether output needs human curation

  - id: h3
    statement: "Trend research requires external data sources"
    rationale: Can't know what's trending without looking at real data
    evidence_needed:
      - What external sources provide useful trend data
      - How to identify kid-relevant trends
      - Whether this is automatable or needs human judgment

experiments:
  - id: calendar_discovery
    hypothesis_id: h1
    description: Generate seasonal topics from upcoming calendar events
    test_steps:
      - Generate topics for next 3 months (Dec, Jan, Feb)
      - Include holidays, seasons, school events
      - Capture suggested timing, audience, and related ideas
    prompts:
      - |
        Generate coloring page topic ideas for the next 3 months (December 2024,
        January 2025, February 2025). For each month, identify:

        1. Major holidays and events
        2. Seasonal themes
        3. School/kid-relevant dates

        For each event, suggest:
        - 3-5 specific coloring page topic ideas
        - Target audience (kids, teens, adults, all)
        - Ideal timing (when to publish relative to event)
        - Any related subcategories (animals + holiday combo, etc.)

        Format as structured data that could go into a database.
    expected:
      - Structured output with dates
      - Multiple topic ideas per event
      - Clear timing recommendations
      - Audience suggestions

  - id: evergreen_brainstorm
    hypothesis_id: h2
    description: Generate evergreen topics via LLM brainstorming
    test_steps:
      - Pick 3 evergreen subcategories (animals, vehicles, fantasy)
      - Generate 20 topic ideas per subcategory
      - Assess novelty and actionability
    prompts:
      - |
        Generate 20 coloring page topic ideas for ANIMALS.

        Requirements:
        - Mix of common (dogs, cats) and unusual (axolotl, pangolin)
        - Consider different contexts (jungle, farm, ocean, pets)
        - Include seasonal variations where relevant (baby animals in spring)
        - Note difficulty level (simple for kids, detailed for adults)

        Format each as:
        - Topic name
        - Brief description (what makes this interesting)
        - Suggested difficulty
        - Any seasonal timing
        - Related topics/combos
      - |
        Generate 20 coloring page topic ideas for VEHICLES.
        [Same format as above]
      - |
        Generate 20 coloring page topic ideas for FANTASY/MYTHICAL.
        [Same format as above]
    expected:
      - 20 ideas per category (60 total)
      - Mix of obvious and creative
      - Useful metadata per topic

  - id: trend_research
    hypothesis_id: h3
    description: Explore what it takes to identify trending topics
    test_steps:
      - Identify potential data sources for kid trends
      - Try to gather current trend information
      - Assess what's automatable vs requires human judgment
    research_questions:
      - What movies/shows are popular with kids right now?
      - What video games are trending?
      - What social media trends translate to coloring pages?
      - How to avoid licensed content issues while riding trends?
    expected:
      - List of potential data sources
      - Assessment of automation feasibility
      - Recommendation for trend discovery workflow
