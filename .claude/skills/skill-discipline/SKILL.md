# Skill Discipline

## Overview

Skills document proven techniques that save time and prevent mistakes. Not using available skills means repeating solved problems and making known errors.

**Core principle:** If a skill for your task exists, you must use it or you will fail at your task.

## The Mandatory Protocol

**BEFORE responding to ANY user message, complete this checklist:**

1. List available skills in your mind
2. Ask yourself: "Does ANY skill match this request?"
3. If yes → Read the skill file
4. Announce which skill you're using
5. Follow the skill exactly

**Responding WITHOUT completing this checklist = failure.**

## The 1% Rule

If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST read the skill.

**IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.**

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.

## Common Rationalizations That Mean You're About To Fail

If you catch yourself thinking ANY of these thoughts, STOP. You are rationalizing. Check for and use the skill.

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |
| "I can check git/files quickly" | Files don't have conversation context. Check for skills. |
| "Let me gather information first" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. Check for skills. |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill" | If a skill exists for it, use it. |
| "I remember this skill" | Skills evolve. Run the current version. |
| "This doesn't count as a task" | If you're taking action, it's a task. Check for skills. |
| "The skill is overkill for this" | Skills exist because simple things become complex. Use it. |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Check for skills BEFORE doing anything. |

## Skills with Checklists

If a skill has a checklist, YOU MUST create TodoWrite todos for EACH item.

**Don't:**
- Work through checklist mentally
- Skip creating todos "to save time"
- Batch multiple items into one todo
- Mark complete without doing them

**Why:** Checklists without TodoWrite tracking = steps get skipped. Every time.

## Announcing Skill Usage

Before using a skill, announce it:

> "I'm using [Skill Name] to [what you're doing]."

**Examples:**
- "I'm using the systematic-debugging skill to investigate this test failure."
- "I'm using the test-driven-development skill to implement this feature."
- "I'm using the git-operations skill for this commit."

**Why:** Transparency helps your partner understand your process and catch errors early. It confirms you actually read the skill.

## Instructions ≠ Permission to Skip Workflows

Your partner's specific instructions describe WHAT to do, not HOW.

"Add X", "Fix Y" = the goal, NOT permission to skip TDD, debugging process, or other workflows.

**Red flags for skipping:**
- "Instruction was specific"
- "Seems simple"
- "Workflow is overkill"

**Reality:** Specific instructions mean clear requirements, which is when workflows matter MOST. Skipping process on "simple" tasks is how simple tasks become complex problems.

## The Bottom Line

Skills are not suggestions. They are proven techniques. Using them is mandatory. Skipping them causes failures.

Check skills first. Announce usage. Follow exactly. Track checklists with TodoWrite.
